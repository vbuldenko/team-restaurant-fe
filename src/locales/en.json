Since opening in 2023, our restaurant has blossomed under the passionate guidance of Nicole Sinner. In 2024, we relocated to our stunning new space in the Pechersk district, complete with a refreshed menu that celebrates the warmth and depth of Italian cuisine. Chef Alex Brim, inspired by family traditions in Southern Italy and classical culinary training, curates dishes that bring the flavors of Italy to life. Our menu is a tribute to seasonal ingredients, showcasing regional specialties from the sun-drenched coasts to the rolling hills of Tuscany. Each plate is crafted to share, fostering a vibrant dining experience filled with conversation and connection. Indulge in our selection of hand-crafted pasta, wood-fired pizzas, fresh Mediterranean seafood, and house-made antipasti. Our expertly curated wine list highlights renowned Italian vineyards, while our cocktail menu offers modern twists on classic Italian aperitifs and digestifs.
